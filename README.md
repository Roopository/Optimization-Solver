# Optimization-Solver
The primary purpose of the code is to optimize a group of individuals' preferences to create the most optimal assignement of individuals so that everyone is as satisfied as possible with the people they are working with, the project/group they are working on and the role they are performing in that group.

The code is based on the paper which is a part of the repository called "Tractable Model for the Optimization of Group Assignments Based on Preferences Over Positions and Other Individuals". This paper is written by the creator of this repository and is an original concept.

This code relies on the Gurobi for C++ solver, which is included as "gurobi_c++.h".
