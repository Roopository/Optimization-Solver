# Optimization-Solver
Code for the optimization model to find maximize pilot preferences.

This code relies on the Gurobi for C++ solver, which is included as "gurobi_c++.h".

The code is based on the paper which is a part of the repository called "Tractable Model for the Optimization of Group Assignments Based on Preferences Over Positions and Other Individuals". 

The primary purpose of the code is to optimize a group of individuals' preferences to create the most optimal assignement of individuals so that everyone is as satisfied as possible with the people they are working with, the project/group they are working on and the role they are performing in that group.
